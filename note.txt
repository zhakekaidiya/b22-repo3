THIS IS A TEXT FILE

We jiust published our local git repo 
to remote Github.com repository

Few things happened:
1. if automatically created new remote repo under your Github.com
2. made the connection
3. added all your commits to remote repo

How our work will continue locally:
1. add a new file called note.txt
2. commit the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository, so we PUSHED local commits to remote repository using PUSH ORIGIN button
4. observe that he has been added in Github.com
